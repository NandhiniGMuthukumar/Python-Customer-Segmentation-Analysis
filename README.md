# Python-Customer-Segmentation-Analysis

## Objective:
The goal of this project is to analyze customer data and segment them based on their purchasing behavior.

## Key Steps:

### Data Acquisition:

Obtain a dataset containing customer information, including demographics and purchase history.
### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Clean the dataset by handling missing values, outliers, and ensuring data consistency.
Perform necessary preprocessing steps, such as encoding categorical variables.
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of key variables, identify patterns, and gain insights into customer behavior.
Use descriptive statistics and visualizations to present key findings.
### Customer Segmentation:

Utilize clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means) to segment customers based on their purchasing patterns.
Analyze and interpret the characteristics of each customer segment.
### Feature Engineering:

Create new features or derive meaningful metrics from the existing data to enhance the analysis.

### Technologies and Tools:

Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn)
Jupyter Notebooks for interactive development
Matplotlib or Seaborn for data visualization
GitHub for version control
